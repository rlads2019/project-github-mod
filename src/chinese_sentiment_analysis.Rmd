## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(jiebaR)
library(readr)
seg <- worker(user = "path/to/user_dict")
word <- c(segment("失業的熊讚陪柯文哲看銀翼殺手", seg))
ch_senti_lex <- read_csv("ch.senti.lex.csv")
p <- c()
logicc <- c()

for(i in seq_along(word)){
logicc <- ch_senti_lex[,"lemma"] == word[i] 
logicc <- c(logicc)
logicc <- na.omit(ch_senti_lex[logicc, "Polarity"])
p[i] <- logicc[1, "Polarity"]
}

q <- c()

for(i in seq_along(p)){
  q[i] <- p[[i]][1]
}


q <- na.omit(q)

score <- c()

for(i in seq_along(q)){
  
  if(is.na(q[i])){
    score[i] <- 0
  }
  else if(q[i] == "P"){
    score[i] <- 1
  }
  else{
    score[i] <- -1
  }
}
positive <- score[score == 1]
positive_number <- length(positive)
negative <- score[score == -1]
negative_number <- length(negative)

sum(score)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
